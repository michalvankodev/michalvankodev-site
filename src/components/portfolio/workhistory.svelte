  <h3>Work Experience</h3>
  <p>
    I am doing web development for approximately 14 years.
    I've started at very young age of 14.
    My very first web site was for promotion web of my own Counter-Strike clan.
    Then I had an opportunity to create a important registration system
    for marathon runners for Europe's oldest marathon event.
    That basically started off my career as a web developer. I had some projects while I was studying in high school and university.
    After that I started to work full-time as a web developer and gain more experience in developing real-time web applications.

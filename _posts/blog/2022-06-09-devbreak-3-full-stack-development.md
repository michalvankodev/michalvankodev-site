My friend and former colleague [Dominik Štefan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dominik-%C5%A1tefan-167266180/) came by to talk about his experience working on full-stack web application development. We talked about many different topics but most importantly we had a lot of fun.
This episode aired on the 9th of June 2022 and is in the Slovak language.

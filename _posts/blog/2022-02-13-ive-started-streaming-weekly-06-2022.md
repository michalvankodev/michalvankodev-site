  - [ ] Come up with Weekly numbering 
    - Possible solution #WeekNumber-22
  - Last week we've talked about my new upcoming headphones so I thought I would share another video I've liked. It's about different types of headphones and amplifiers https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoLMdrD5pi

I've been thinking of giving the *Weekly* series a **numbering system**. I've come up with the format of `#weekNumber-year`. This article is only a second *Weekly*, but it is published for the sixth week of this year, so it will receive a number `#06-2022`.

## Streaming setup

I use my *Samsung Galaxy S21* as a camera via *DroidCam*. I have even bought the *DroidCamX*, just because it is the only software that successfully allowed me to **connect my phone camera with the PC.**

I needed to improve my camera angle. I was surprised by how quickly I was able to resolve this. We went shopping with my fiance and I found a wireless selfie stick that can be put into stand mode at the cash registers. I've immediately added it into the basket. It serves as a camera holder.

I was thinking about how I could leverage scenes in *OBS* to make the streaming settings more maintainable. A thought hit me that I can **compose scenes** into each other just like objects in programming. I couldn't be the first to think of it, so I've tried to find somewhere on the internet a tutorial on how others manage it. I've found a great [tutorial on *YouTube* by *Gaming Careers*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvzAoqXtREw), where he gives some tips on how to manage and compose scenes. I've created some scenes to be able to start streaming.

I asked one of my colleagues for a favor to **encourage me to start to stream**. We went on a call and I've started to stream. We were just talking about basic stuff around programming, but I've really enjoyed it.
I left a note for myself that this post is being written during the first broadcast.

> I am streaming right now as I am writing this post!

Broadcasting is very demanding for resources so to make better quality content I will eventually have to **buy a dedicated computer**.
I've set a new **sub goal** for buying a streaming PC. I'll buy it when the stream will **reach 50 subs**. Wish me luck!

## Picks for this week

Last week I've been showing off new headphones that I've ordered and the *YouTube* algorithm has been suggesting great videos on the topic since. I will give another shoutout. This time it is to [Joshua's Valour *YouTube* channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCx9bOYEjkevIDYONBAstK-A)

My next pick will be a [podcast *Lifespan* hosted by Dr. David Sinclair](https://open.spotify.com/show/3PkkSdQE8DfeiKvSk1Mg1J) where he talks about what we can do and how should we treat our bodies to live a longer and healthier life.

In our management course, we've been learning about different **person typologies**. That helped me to understand how I should treat other people and how to communicate better with them.

That's it for this week. Thank you very much!

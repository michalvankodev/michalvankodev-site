  - [ ] Come up with Weekly numbering 
    - Possible solution #WeekNumber-22
  - Last week we've talked about my new upcoming headphones so I thought I would share another video I've liked. It's about different types of headphones and amplifiers https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoLMdrD5pi

I've been thinking of the numbering for this series of articles. I've come up with the format of `#weekNumber-year`. This article will be published for the sixth week of this year the name is `#06-2022`.

## Streaming setup

I've bought a wireless selfie stick that can be put into stand mode and works as a camera holder. I use my Samsung Galaxy S21 as a camera via *DroidCam*. I have even bought the *DroidCamX* just because it is the only software that successfully allowed me to connect my phone camera with the PC.

I was thinking about how I could leverage scenes in OBS to make the streaming setup more maintainable and a thought hit me that I can compose scenes into each other just like in programming. I couldn't be the first to think of it, so I've tried to find somewhere on the internet a tutorial on how others manage it. I've found a great [tutorial on *YouTube* by 
*Gaming Careers*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvzAoqXtREw), where he gives some tips on how to manage and compose scenes. I've created some scenes to be able to start streaming.

I asked one of my colleagues for a favor to encourage me to start to stream. We went on a call and I've started to stream.
I left a note for myself that this post is being written on the first broadcast.

> I am streaming right now as I am writing this post!

Broadcasting is very demanding for resources so to make better quality content I will have to eventually buy a dedicated computer.
I've set a new **sub goal** for buying a streaming PC. I'll buy it when the stream will **reach 50 subs**. Wish me luck!

## Picks for this week

Last week I've been showing off new headphones that I've ordered and the *YouTube* algorithm has been suggesting great videos on the topic since. So I will give another shoutout. This time it is to [Joshua's Valour *YouTube* channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCx9bOYEjkevIDYONBAstK-A)

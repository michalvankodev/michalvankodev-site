I've finished another custom keyboard build this year. It got me motivated to share my experience with custom keyboards with the community. I've got in touch with a friendly community in Poprad by recommendation. I haven't done any presentations for a few years. My positive keyboard experience re-ignited my passion. Hopefully, it sparked some ideas and someone finds my tips helpful.

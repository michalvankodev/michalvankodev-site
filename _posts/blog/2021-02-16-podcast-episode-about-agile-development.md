Last week I've been invited as a guest in [Sudolabs Products podcasts](https://open.spotify.com/show/2sAEYvBrVtH74BZP8VGtx2). I've been interviewed by the host and my colleague Ján Koscelanský on my experience with **building and leading** the team behind [The Expert](https://theexpert.com). We were also talking about implementing *Continous Integration* and *End to End* testing with [Cypress framework](https://www.cypress.io/).

I have to admit, it was a wonderful experience and I've enjoyed it. I'd like to do it again in the future. 

The episode was **recorded in Slovak** language. You can **listen to the podcast episode here**:

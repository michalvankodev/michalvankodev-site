## Realization

What can you do on an airplane when you cannot move as your son is sleeping on your lap? You can **write a new blog post**, "obviously". Why can't I find more time to write more posts? I lack the motivation, to be honest. Now that anyone can just ask an LLM to spit out an original blog post on demand, who will search for original, honest content written by a human? 

I've set expectations for my wife that this year we won't be going on a vacation, and she has overruled and found a one-week trip to Mallorca. I can confirm that we will be **coming back to Mallorca** for further exploration. This week was very nice. I haven't made any commitments on what I'm going to do with my career. I've already **accomplished** that since this year, **I will work on Rust projects**.

## Drift

In my latest vlog, I mentioned that I should talk more about burning out, and that I don't feel like I am burning out. Since then, I stopped streaming and stopped producing videos. **Did I jinx myself?** I don't know. Being active on social media is not something for me. I enjoy streaming, but I just had to put my family above my fulfillment. **I enjoy putting my son to sleep** much more. He is growing so fast. I expect that in a few years **we will start streaming together** as he explores the world of computers.

I expect to find **more time for streaming** when the sun falls in earlier hours.

You should've seen him. He was able to fill his bucket and pour it into a hole in the sand more than 100 times in a row. Where he finds the energy to do this is unbelievable. He is such an extraordinary individual. 

## Inertia

*What about the game progress?*

**The game is in a terrible state**. I realized that the **whole animation system has to be rewritten** as it is unreliable. And that's almost everything that we have been working on. I've started to **write the game design document** so I don't lose my thoughts on mechanics and game setting. I should find more time to code as well, but currently, **I have just enough work and studies to keep me occupied**.

## Sight

Here are some photos from the trip:

Some of them are taken with my *Fuji X-Michal* and I have to say I've fallen in love with the machine. I wish some features were more accessible, and I hope with the new Fuji X-E5 announcement that the *Film simulation recipes* will be included in a future firmware upgrade. The current configuration is very misleading and not user-friendly.

I've also ordered a new Sigma 16-300, hoping it will be delivered before the vacation. I have already **been waiting for it for 2 months**, and still no indication of when it will arrive. I am pretty new to the hobby, and it looks like when ordering a new gear, there is a **guarantee of a long waiting time**, or it is out of stock pretty quickly.

I'd like to **post more pictures** here on the blog. I'm planning on releasing albums. I don't know if I should also make some changes to the visualization, or if the current blog page rendering system is fine as it is. **Let me know if you have some cool ideas**.

I'm going to keep it short. We've landed successfully. The vacation was amazing. We are definitely coming back to Mallorca. Expect more content (soon). 

Happy summer.

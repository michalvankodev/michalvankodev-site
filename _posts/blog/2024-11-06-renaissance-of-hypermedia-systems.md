My goal for this year was to make a presentation. I've told this to my friend Lukáš Orgován and he offered me an opportunity to come present at their workplace with him.  This was a great event and I'm so glad I could attend.

I've chosen a topic very close to my heart and wanted to show a different approach to building mobile and web applications.

The presentation is in Slovak with English subtitles.

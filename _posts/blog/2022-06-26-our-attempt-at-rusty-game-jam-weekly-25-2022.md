## We are married

I noticed that I haven't even posted about our wedding day.
It was the best day of my life. Very beautiful day. I cried almost the whole day because it was so beautiful. I love my wife!

## Rusty game jam

This week I've attended a [Rusty game jam #2](https://itch.io/jam/rusty-jam-2). It was a great experience for me as I have been able to **dive deeper into Rust and [bevy game-development engine](https://bevyengine.org/)**. Big thanks to [@silen-z](https://github.com/silen-z/), who joined my team and helped me get going at the start. We **didn't manage to finish the game** in time. As we only had a week and we also didn't code each day of the week. We have only been able to get some collision mechanics and map creation working. But I am very proud anyway. You can [check the source code for the game on my GitHub](https://github.com/michalvankodev/egg-fetcher/) and also [download binaries to try the game out](https://github.com/michalvankodev/egg-fetcher/releases/tag/v1.1) on any platform. Thanks to [@septum](https://github.com/septum) for providing [a good boilerplate for a bevy project](https://github.com/septum/rusty_jam_bevy_template). The whole process was **broadcasted on my stream**. I am very thankful for anyone who participated.

## What's up with the weeklys

I have to admit something. I was not inspired or motivated to write weeklys for the last two months. For that, I feel a little bumped as there were many good thoughts worth sharing. I was not very comfortable writing as the last month was very tough. During that time I was focused on inner development and figuring out how my brain responds to different stimuli. I've been able to find a new project to work on. The onboarding story was one of the hardest I went through. I managed to move on and stop thinking about what could've I done better in the past and focus more on what can I do better now.

## Picks

I should have at least 10 recommendations, but I haven't accumulated any in my notes.

But here are some podcasts that made my days better:

* [Podcast Nevyhoreni (not burnt out)](https://open.spotify.com/show/0SvQ7orsdxIFhfEgEzcZuF) by Forbes Slovensko
* Definitively [check out Primeagen's last few videos](https://www.youtube.com/c/ThePrimeagen). He inspires me so much. Doesn't have a problem talking about his failures openly on the internet.

Another good resource I've been able to find is another Rust framework for building Web applications called [Sycamore](https://sycamore-rs.netlify.app/).

That's it. Let's jump into another week inspired after a very successful one and my plan is to get better with Rust. I will try to find a new project to work on. Something smaller that could improve my workflow.

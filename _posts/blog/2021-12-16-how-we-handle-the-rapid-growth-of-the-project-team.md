I've been interviewed by my friend [@zubkka](https://www.instagram.com/zubkka/) about my current position at _The Expert_ team as an Engineering Manager. We have talked about my journey at [sudolabs](https://sudolabs.com) but also about my early years and how I've got into programming. Please, [go check out the interview](https://sudolabs.com/blog/how-we-handle-the-rapid-growth-of-the-project-team) and let me know what you think. Happy reading!

In this episode, I've invited my friend [Pavol Dudrík](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pavol-dudr%C3%ADk-043100168/) to talk about what motivates us and makes us happy about the work of the Engineering manager. This job combines two views, and the transition from engineer to manager is often full of pitfalls. We want to share our experience and dispel misconceptions often associated with managerial positions in IT.
This episode aired on the 4th of February 2023 and is in the Slovak language.

work_history_prelude: >-
  I am doing web development for approximately 14 years. I've started at very
  young age of 14. My very first web site was for promotion web of my own
  Counter-Strike clan.

  Then I had an opportunity to create a important registration system for
  marathon runners for Europe's oldest marathon event. That basically started
  off my career as a web developer. I had some projects while I was studying in
  high school and university. After that I started to work full-time as a web
  developer and gain more experience in developing real-time web applications.
